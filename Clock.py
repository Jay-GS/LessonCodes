from time import strftime #from time import strftime: Imports the strftime function from the time module,
                        #which is used to format date and time.

def time():
    string = strftime('%H:%M:%S: %p') #string = strftime('%H:%M:%S %p'): Gets the current time formatted as hours (%H),

                              #(1 second), creating a loop that continuously updates the time every second.

label = Label(root, font=("ds-digital", 100), background="red", foreground="blue")# label = Label(root,
       #font=("ds-digital", 100), background="black", foreground="green"): Creates a Label widget with the specified properties:

label.pack(anchor='center') #label.pack(anchor='center'): Packs the label into the main window and centers it.

time() #This calls the time function.

mainloop()#This line starts the Tkinter event loop, which waits for events (such as button clicks) and updates the GUI as needed. This loop runs indefinitely until the user closes the window.
